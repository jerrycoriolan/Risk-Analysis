# Risk-Analysis

Identifying Cybersecurity Threats:

A Risk assessment for a hospital wanting to pass all cyber security legal and compliance regulations. 

Step 1:
Identifying potential Threats to the organization 
-	Malicious actors/hackers attempting to steal patient information
-	Disgruntled employee 
-	Virus/malware infecting the hospital 
-	Natural disasters or physical threat 

Identifying potential threats at the project, application, or asset level 
-	Applications or OS can be vulnerable to a specific type of attacks; identifying will be more specific here
-	Malicious actors/hackers attempting to steal patient information 
-	Disgruntled employee 
-	Malware

Step 2:
Conducting a cybersecurity risk assessment for an application: 
The hospital has an application which stores payment information and customer information and is not connected to the internet

Identify Threats
1.	Is this application exposed to hackers?
Probably not because it is not connected to the internet 

2.	Is this application exposed to not being available for customers?
Yes, valid threat

If yes, what is the impact on the organization, low, medium, or high?
Potentially medium to high, if a group of customers are trying to pay and the application is down, is there another way to process those payments? 
Are there measures in place to act as a temporary solution if the application is down?
-	Will not reduce the likelihood of a risk but will reduce the impact. 


# Responding to risk 
-	My phone is too big for my shorts 
-	Shorts that I wear to my annual rivalry game
-	I play in those shorts in the annual rivalry game every year 
-	I have lost my phone going to see my aunt twice in the past ten years 

The risk here is the phone falls out of my shorts, but I must play in the rivalry game. 

When responding to risks, there are four treatment strategies:

Risk acceptance 
-	On average, the phone will fall out of my pocket every five years. Will I accept this risk?

Risk avoidance
-	I will always stay in the house to avoid my phone falling out of my pocket, but it is not practical. 

Risk transference 
-	Financial – AppleCare, but anything not backed up in the cloud will be lost, and potentially, my reputation or trust could be lost if I had any secrets on my phone. 

Risk mitigation
-	Bright phone case, thick case, more oversized shorts, a pouch, or a clip


# Qualitative & Quantitative Risk Management
To do some analysis and the likelihood of this happening, there are two ways:

Qualitative risk management – Approximation of how bad an impact can be 
o	Likelihood can also be called probability
o	Consequence can also be called severity or impact

How likely is my phone going to fall out of pocket?
-  One phone every five years is 20%, and that is possible, not likely, so 3 
-  The impact of losing my phone and the information is catastrophic, so 5 
-  3X5= 15, which is extreme, but most companies are willing to take the risk

Risk Register 
-  An important place, software, or spreadsheet to capture, identify, document, and propose solutions and mitigate controls for risks.
-  It allows senior management and the board of directors to view the risks within the organization and prioritize them.
-  Decision-makers will use the register to prioritize whether to accept the risk or develop a mitigation plan.

Qualitative issues:
-	You can’t prioritize between risks; for example, if you have three 12s, which do you prioritize? 
-	Judgment calls, you can’t just add them.
-	Everything below 10 or 12 is usually accepted, and everything above that is addressed, but there are fewer options at the top, and with the 5X5 matrix, there are fewer options. 
-	Many matrices are used; 5x5, 5x4, and 3x3 are some of the more common.

Quantitative risk management 
Asset value: phone is $1000
Likelihood is a %: 1/5 = 20% 
Damage is the single loss expectancy SLC: every time I lose the phone, it costs $500 every time it falls out of my pocket every five years. 

Annual Loss Expectancy ALE: $100 every year will be $500 in year five, and by that time, we must pay to get a new phone, so we need to save $100 per year  

Inherent Risk: is where we started; we started off knowing that we lose our phone every five years 

Residual Risk: How much risk is there after we add a mitigating control? 
With the new case, the percentage goes down to 10% now 
The SLE stays the same at $500, but the ALE now goes down $50 a year 

Annual Rate of Occurrence:
Inherent Risk is 20% 
Residual Risk is 10%
